# Vitis AI 6.2

Vitis AI is AMD's development stack for AI inference on AMD adaptive computing platforms. Release **6.2** supports two device series:

- **AMD Versal AI Edge Series**
- **AMD Versal AI Edge Series Gen 2**

The compiler, software dependencies, and associated tools and utilities are device-series specific, which is why content is organized per device series.
